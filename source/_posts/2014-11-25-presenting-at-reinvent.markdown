Thinknear was priviledged to be invited to present at AWS re:Invent 2014. Our topic was on how we have scaled to billions of daily requests on Elastic Beanstalk. Here's a direct link to our agenda summary, [APP 402](https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=8726).

You can check us out on the [AWS YouTube Channel](http://bit.ly/1qR0mEi). You can view our slides on [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/app402?qid=0a3f4642-757a-484b-a850-c34b0cb8b865&v=default&b=&from_search=1). You can even listen to us as a podcast on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/app402-serving-billions-web/id941313180?i=324951733&mt=2).

Thank you, AWS, for inviting us.
